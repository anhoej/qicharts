  "body": "# Quality improvement charts\r\n\r\nThe **qicharts** package contains functions for plotting run charts and Shewhart control charts for measure and count data.\r\n\r\nThe main function is `qic()`, which in its simplest form takes a vector of values, plots a run chart, and performs tests for non-random variation in the data sequence. Non-random variation may be the result of deliberate process improvement or unintentional, possibly unwanted, changes in process performance.\r\n\r\n`qic()` has a simple interface with a rich set of options to control data analysis and plotting, including options for automatic data aggregation by subgroups, easy analysis of before-and-after data, exclusion of one or more data points from analysis, and splitting charts into sequential time periods. Missing values and empty subgroups are handled gracefully.\r\n\r\nThe `trc()` function creates trellis run charts, i.e. small multiple run charts from multivariate data.\r\n\r\n`tcc()` is an experimental function aiming at replacing `trc()` and, eventually, `qic()`. It allows for multivariate run and control charts in trellis layout.\r\n\r\nThe `paretochart()` function plots a pareto chart from categorical data.\r\n\r\nFor quick demos, run\r\n```\r\nexample(qic)\r\nexample(trc)\r\nexample(tcc)\r\nexample(paretochart)\r\nvignette('runcharts')\r\nvignette('controlcharts')\r\n```\r\nThen read the help files\r\n```\r\n?qic\r\n?trc\r\n?tcc\r\n?paretochart\r\n```\r\nInstall latest release version of qicharts from CRAN\r\n```\r\ninstall.packages('qicharts')\r\n```\r\nOr install development version from GitHub\r\n```\r\nrequire(devtools)\r\ninstall_github('anhoej/qicharts')\r\n```\r\n",
