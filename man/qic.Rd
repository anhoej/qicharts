\arguments{
\item{y}{Numeric vector of counts or measures to plot. Mandatory.}

\item{n}{Numeric vector of sample sizes. Mandatory for P and U charts.}

\item{x}{Subgrouping vector used for aggregating data and making x-labels.
Mandatory for Xbar and S charts.}

\item{data}{Data frame containing variables.}

\item{chart}{Type of control chart. Possible types are: \itemize{ \item
"run": run chart (default). \item "i": individuals chart. \item "mr":
moving range chart. \item "xbar": sample average chart. \item "s": sample
standard deviation chart. \item "t": time between events chart. \item "p":
proportions chart. \item "c": counts chart. \item "u": rates chart. \item
"g": cases between events chart. }}

\item{notes}{Character vector of notes to be added to individual. data
points.}

\item{cl}{Value specifying the center line (if known). Must be of length one
or same as number of subgroups (for variable center line).}

\item{ylim}{Range of y axis limits.}

\item{target}{Value specifying a target line to plot.}

\item{freeze}{Number identifying the last data point to include in
calculations of center and limits (ignored if \code{breaks} argument is
given).}

\item{breaks}{Numeric vector of break points. Useful for splitting graph in
two or more sections with separate center line and control limits.}

\item{exclude}{Numeric vector of data points to exclude from calculations of
center and control lines.}

\item{negy}{Logical value, if TRUE, the y axis is allowed to be negative
(only relevant for I and Xbar charts).}

\item{dots.only}{Logical value. If TRUE, data points are not connected by
lines and runs analysis is not performed. Useful for comparison and funnel
plots.}

\item{multiply}{Integer indicating a number to multiply y axis by, e.g. 100
for percents rather than proportions.}

\item{prime}{Logical value, if TRUE, control limits incorporate
between-subgroup variation as proposed by Laney (2002). This is recommended
for data involving very large sample sizes. Only relevant for P and U
charts.}

\item{standardised}{Logical value, if TRUE, creates a standardised control
chart, where points are plotted in standard deviation units along with a
center line at zero and control limits at 3 and -3. Only relevant for P, U
and Xbar charts.}

\item{x.format}{Date format of x axis labels. See ?strftime for date formats.}

\item{nint}{Number indicating (approximately) the desired number of tick
marks on the x axis.}

\item{cex}{Number indicating the amount by which text and symbols should be
magnified.}

\item{main}{Character string specifying the title of the plot.}

\item{xlab}{Character string specifying the x axis label.}

\item{ylab}{Character string specifying the y axis label.}

\item{sub}{Character string specifying a subtitle to be printed in the lower
left corner of the plot.}

\item{decimals}{Integer indicating the number of decimals shown for center
and limits on the plot. Default behaviour is smart rounding to at least two
significant digits.}

\item{pre.text}{Character string labelling pre-freeze period}

\item{post.text}{Character string labelling post-freeze period}

\item{runvals}{Logical value, if TRUE, prints statistics from runs analysis
on plot.}

\item{linevals}{Logical value, if TRUE, prints values for center and control
lines on plot.}

\item{plot.chart}{Logical value, if TRUE, prints plot.}

\item{prnt}{Logical value, if TRUE, prints return value. Deprecated, use
print.out instead.}

\item{print.out}{Logical value, if TRUE, prints return value}

\item{...}{Further arguments to plot function.}

\value{
A list of of class qic containing values and parameters of the qic
  plot.

\description{
Run and control charts for quality improvement and control
}
\details{
If \code{chart} is not specified, \code{qic()} plots a \strong{run
  chart}. Non-random variation will be marked by a dashed, red center line
  (the median) if either the longest run of data points above or below the
  median is longer than predicted or if the graph crosses the median fewer
  times than predicted (see references for details).

  Only the \code{y} argument giving the count or measure of interest is
  mandatory for a run chart. If a denominator argument, \code{n}, is given,
  \eqn{y/n} will be plotted. If a subgrouping argument, \code{x}, is given,
  \eqn{sum(y)/sum(n)}, within each subgroup will be plotted.

  With \strong{controlcharts}, data aggregation by subgroups is handled
  according to chart type. For P, U, and I charts, data are aggregated as
  described for the run chart. For the C chart, the sum of counts,
  \code{sum(y)}, within each subgroups will be plotted.

  For Xbar and S charts, the subgrouping argument, \code{x}, is mandatory.
  However, the sample size argument, \code{n}, is irrelevant and will be
  ignored.

  The subgrouping argument, \code{x}, is irrelevant for T and G charts, and,
  if given, an error will occur if any subgroup has more than one element.

  If more than one \code{note} is present within any subgroup, the first
  \code{note} (alphabetically) is chosen.

  If both \code{prime} and \code{standardised} are \code{TRUE}, points are
  plotted in units corresponding to Laney's modified "standard deviation",
  which incorporates the variation between subgroups.
