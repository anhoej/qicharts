Description: Functions for making run charts and  basic Shewhart control
    charts for measure and count data.
    The main function, qic(), creates run and control charts and has a
    simple interface with a rich set of options to control data analysis
    and plotting, including options for automatic data aggregation by
    subgroups, easy analysis of before-and-after data, exclusion of one
    or more data points from analysis, and splitting charts into
    sequential time periods.
    Missing values and empty subgroups are handled gracefully.
