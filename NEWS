qicharts 0.1.4
=================
* Fixed target argument to multiply argument
* cl argument now takes a vector of lenght >= 1 (is this a good idea?)

qicharts 0.1.3
=================
* Improved graph design based on the priciples of Stephen Few (perceptualedge.com).
* Added argument to produce I control charts in trc function.
* Added argument 'primed' to the qic function, correcting narrow control limits
  when using P or U charts on data involving very large sample sizes.
* Added argument 'standardised' to the qic function. When using P, U or Xbar
  charts, this allows the plotting of data points in standard deviation units
  with control limits at -3 and 3 along with a center line at zero.
* If so desired, P and U charts can be primed and standardised at the same time.
* Smart rounding (to at least two significant digits) is used by default for
  median labels in trc charts. The 'dec' argument still provides manual control
  if needed.
* Smart rounding is also the default for central line and control limit labels
  in qic charts. The 'decimals' argument allows manual control of decimal digits.

qicharts 0.1.2
=================
* Set control limits outside possible range to NA in T, P, U, and G charts.

qicharts 0.1.1
=================
* The trc function now retuns a lattice object.

* Added arguments to control printing character and colours in trc function.

* Added dec argument to control the number of decimals on the label of
  the center line in trc function.

* The qic function now plots the main curve on top of other lines in the plot.

* Fixed an error caused if data frame argument holds a data frame
  created with the group_by function from dplyr.

qicharts 0.1.0
=================
* First release.
