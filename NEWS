qicharts 0.4.3
=================
* Added centre and control line value label to single panel plots in tcc().
* New argument, dec, to tcc() specifying the number of decimals in line labels.
* Fixed issue with empty subgroups being summed to 0 rather than NA in tcc().
* Fixed "infinite" control limits in tcc().
* Fixed loading errors caused by imports from scales.

qicharts 0.4.2
=================
* Removed empty levels from data frame in tcc().
* Fixed a bug in qic() that handles run charts with more than half of the data points having same value.

qicharts 0.4.1
=================
* Fixed undefined globals

qicharts 0.4.0
=================
* New experimental function, tcc(), trellis control charts. Aims at replacing trc() and, eventually, qic(). Allows for multivariate run and control charts in lattice (grid) layout.
* New argument, direction, in qic() and trc() functions. Adds an up or down arrow indicating the desired direction of improvement to qic plots and is used together with the target argument to colour code the centre line in qic and trc plots.
* Added colour coding of centre line. Red means stable process on the wrong side of the target. Green means stable process on the right side of the target. Amber means unstable process (= non-random variation is present).
* Fixed a calculation error in T chart
* Median line is suppressed in run charts if more than half of the data points have the same value.

qicharts 0.3.2
=================
* Fixed handling of missing data in prime charts.
* primed argument in qic() function is deprecated, use prime instead.
* Minor adjustments to plot margins.
* New argument, agg.fun, in qic() function. Specifies the aggregate function if there is more than one value per subgroup.

qicharts 0.3.1
=================
* Fixed undefined globals in package

qicharts 0.3.0
=================
* New argument, sub, in qic() function. Prints a subtitle at lower left corner.
* New function, plot.qic(), plots a qic object.
* qic() now returns a list object of class 'qic' for plotting with plot.qic().
* prnt argument in qic() function will be deprecated, use print.out instead.
* New vignette "controlcharts".
* Vignette "runcharts" updated.

qicharts 0.2.0
=================
* Added nint argument to qic() function control the number of tick marks on the x axis.
* Fixed target argument of qic() function to obey multiply argument.
* cl argument of qic() function now takes a vector of length either one or the number of subgroups (for variable centre line in run charts).
* Minor code clean-up.
* Added cex argument to trc() function to control dot size (thanks to John MacKintosh, @HighlandAnalyst).
* Added gap argument to trc() function to control spacing between panels.
* Added target argument to trc() function.
* Title of trellis run charts is now left justified and of normal font weight (thanks to Markus Gesmann, www.magesblog.com).
* Fixed a typo in graph output (usefull -> useful).
* Added two recent run chart references to help section and vignette.

qicharts 0.1.3
=================
* Improved graph design based on the principles of Stephen Few (perceptualedge.com).
* Added argument to produce I control charts in trc() function.
* Added argument 'primed' to the qic() function, correcting narrow control limits
  when using P or U charts on data involving very large sample sizes.
* Added argument 'standardised' to the qic() function. When using P, U or Xbar
  charts, this allows the plotting of data points in standard deviation units
  with control limits at -3 and 3 along with a centre line at zero.
* If so desired, P and U charts can be primed and standardised at the same time.
* Smart rounding (to at least two significant digits) is used by default for
  median labels in trc charts. The 'dec' argument still provides manual control
  if needed.
* Smart rounding is also the default for central line and control limit labels
  in qic charts. The 'decimals' argument allows manual control of decimal digits.

qicharts 0.1.2
=================
* Set control limits outside possible range to NA in T, P, U, and G charts.

qicharts 0.1.1
=================
* The trc() function now returns a lattice object.
* Added arguments to control printing character and colours in trc() function.
* Added dec argument to control the number of decimals on the label of
  the centre line in trc() function.
* The qic() function now plots the main curve on top of other lines in the plot.
* Fixed an error caused if data frame argument holds a data frame
  created with the group_by function from dplyr.

qicharts 0.1.0
=================
* First release.
